              <h2>What Honey Promised</h2>
              <p>
                Honey marketed itself as a free browser extension that automatically finds and applies 
                the best coupon codes at checkout. With celebrity endorsements and viral marketing, 
                it accumulated over 17 million users who trusted it to save them money.

                  <h3>Affiliate Link Hijacking</h3>
                  <p>
                    Investigators found silent overwriting of creator affiliate codes. Content creators 
                    reported lost commissions.

                  <p>
                    Investigators reported tracking of page views, cart additions, and purchases. 
                    Data was reportedly shared with retailers.

                    Users reported finding better deals publicly. The coupon-search animation was 
                    questioned by investigators.

                    Investigators reported retailer payments to prioritize certain deals. Users 
                    disputed whether they received the best available price.

              <h2>The Aftermath</h2>
              <p>
                After MegaLag's exposé in December 2024, Honey faced widespread backlash. Content 
                creators reported years of lost commissions. Users reported that savings were 
                not guaranteed. Honey continues to operate, backed by PayPal's acquisition.

              <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
              <ul className="lessons-list">
                <li>
                  <strong>Star ratings mean nothing.</strong> Honey had 4.9 stars and millions of 
                  reviews—all while actively harming users.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Free products aren't free.</strong> When you're not paying, you're the 
                  product being sold.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Permissions matter.</strong> "Read and change all your data on all 
                  websites" should be a red flag.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Trust the code, not the marketing.</strong> Static analysis would have 
                  caught Honey's affiliate hijacking years ago.
                </li>
